            <h3 class="card-title" style="text-decoration: underline;">Warren Buffett</h3>
            <p>Born : 30 August (1930-present)</p>
            <p>Warren Edward Buffett was born on August 30, 1930, to his mother Leila and father Howard, a
                stockbroker-turned-Congressman. The second oldest, he had two sisters and displayed an amazing aptitude
                for both money and business at a very early age. Acquaintances recount his uncanny ability to calculate
                columns of numbers off the top of his head—a feat Warren still amazes business colleagues with today.
            </p>
            <p>While other children his age were playing hopscotch and jacks, Warren was making money. At only six years
                old, Buffett purchased six-packs of Coca-Cola from his grandfather's grocery store for 25 cents and
                resold each of the bottles for a nickel, pocketing a 5-cent profit. Five years later, Buffett took his
                first step into the world of high finance.</p>
            <p>At eleven years old, he purchased three shares of Cities Service Preferred at $38 per share for both
                himself and his older sister Doris. Shortly after buying the stock, it fell to just over $27 per share.
                A frightened but resilient Warren held his shares until they rebounded to $40. He promptly sold them—a
                mistake he would soon come to regret. Cities Service shot up to $200.1 The experience taught him one of
                the basic lessons of investing: Patience is a virtue.</p>

                <div class="card-body">
            <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Education</span></h3>
            <p>In 1947, Warren Buffett graduated from high school when he was 17 years old. It was never his intention
                to go to college. His father had other plans for him and urged his son to attend the Wharton Business
                School at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
            <p>Buffett only stayed two years, complaining that he knew more than his professors. He returned home to
                Omaha and transferred to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Despite working full-time, he managed to
                graduate in only three years.</p>
            <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Success</span></h3>
            <p>Once he had arrived in New York, Buffett had the opportunity to test and develop the theories he had
                learned from Graham during his studies.
                Buffett returned to Omaha in 1956 and he launched Buffett associates limited. In 1962 Buffett made a
                collaboration with Charlie Munger and then they purchased Berkshire Hathaway. Warren Buffett’s
                investments haven’t always been successful, but he made all the investments after full study, and all
                the investments are followed by value principles. He never brings his emotions in the trade. He always
                keeps his eye on new opportunities and always sticks to consistent strategy. This thing made him
                different from others and help him in achieving success in his life.</p>
            <p>After all of his efforts, hard work, dedication, business skills, money-making, and money savings skills
                he becomes one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the world.

                Now Buffett is a great American businessman, investor, speaker, and philanthropist. He is considered one
                of the most successful investors in the world. He has a net worth of US $89.9 Billion as of May 4, 2019.
                And he is the third richest person in the world after Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates.</p>
