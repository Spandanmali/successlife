            <h5 class="card-title">Bernard Arnault</h5>
            <p>Born : 5 March (1949-present)</p>
            <p>He was born as Bernard Jean Etienne Arnault on the 5th of March 1949 in Roubaix, France as the son of
                Jean Leon Arnault. His father was a manufacturer who owned a civil engineering company, Ferret-Savinel.

                He attended Maxence Van Der Meersch High School in Roubaix. After completing his schooling, he entered
                the Prestigious Ecole Polythenique and graduated with a degree in engineering in 1971.</p>
            <h3><span style="text-decoration:underline ;">Bernard Arnault Career</span></h3>
            <p>Bernard became involved in his fatherâ€™s business after graduating from college, and he planned for the
                company to expand its horizons and become involved in other more profitable businesses.

                His first action within the company was to convince his father to disband the construction division and
                reap the benefits. After the construction was dissolved, the family began investing in real estate and
                became quite successful in doing so.</p>
            <p>Bernard was quickly moving up the ranks in the company and was the director of development in the year
                1974, CEO in 1977, and surpassed his father by becoming president in 1979.

                In the year 1981, the French Socialists forced the family to relocate to America, and even there, they
                continued to flourish by branch out their real estate to the US.</p>
            <p>Arnault returned to France in the year 1983 and saw a golden opportunity to expand into the textile
                industry when the firm Boussac Saint-Freres was bankrupt. He co-operated with Antonie Bernheim, a
                managing partner who worked for an investment firm called Lazard Freres to fund his purchase of
                Boussac.Upon receiving the company, Arnault sold most of the shares and kept only the Christian Dior
                brand and the department store Le Bon Marche. By 1985 he was the CEO of Dio</p>
            <p>In the year 1987, Arnault was invited to invest in the LVMH company and eventually chose to invest in a
                joint share with the Guinness PLC.

                Throughout the next few years, he would continue to invest and gain more of the company. By the year
                1989, he had control of 43.5% of the company shares and began to immediately replace the old average
                employees and replace them with new ones who would exceed his expectations.</p>
