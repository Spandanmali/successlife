            <h5 class="card-title" style="text-decoration: underline;">Elon Musk</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Born:28 june (1971-present)</p>
            <p class="card-text">Updated July 20,2021</p>
            <p class="card-text">Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and businessman who founded
                X.com in
                1999 (which later became PayPal), SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. Musk became a
                multimillionaire in his
                late 20s when he sold his start-up company, Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Musk made headlines in May 2012, when SpaceX launched a rocket that would send the
                first
                commercial vehicle to the International Space Station. He bolstered his portfolio with the purchase of
                SolarCity
                in 2016 and cemented his standing as a leader of industry by taking on an advisory role in the early
                days of
                President Donald Trump's administration.

                In January 2021, Musk reportedly surpassed Jeff Bezos as the wealthiest man in the world.</p>
            <h4 style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Early Life</strong></h4>
            <p class="card-text">Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. As a child, Musk was so lost
                in
                his daydreams about inventions that his parents and doctors ordered a test to check his hearing.</p>

            <p class="card-text">At about the time of his parents’ divorce, when he was 10, Musk developed an interest
                in
                computers. He taught himself how to program, and when he was 12 he sold his first software: a game he
                created
                called Blastar.</p>
            <p class="card-text">In grade school, Musk was short, introverted and bookish. He was bullied until he was
                15 and
                went through a growth spurt and learned how to defend himself with karate and wrestling.</p>
            <h3><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Success Story of The Tech Buff</strong></h3>
            <p class="card-text">In 1995, Musk joined his brother Kimbal in inaugurating Zip2, an IT company that
                licenced
                newspaper software for online city guides. The Company didn’t attract many in its first few years, but
                afterwards, the local and domestic newspapers finally started using Zip2 to sell their respective
                customers
                additional services. In 1999, Zip2 was bought for a whopping $340 million by Compaq’s AltaVista web
                search
                engine.

                Musk then founded X.com, online financial services and email payment firm, with its business partners
                Peter
                Thiel and Max Levchin. X.com joined the American software corporation Confinity in 2000, which is best
                known for
                developing PayPal. Shortly before eBay bought PayPal at $1.5 billion in 2001, Musk was named President
                and CEO
                of PayPal. Here, Musk eventually had the funds to put the Internet business behind to channel his
                attention to
                engineering business as an equity investor with nearly 180 million dollars in shares.</p>
            <h3><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Struggling and Rising Years</strong></h3>
            <p class="card-text">
                In 2004, Musk played an instrumental role in designing the first electric car of Tesla named “The Tesla
                Roadster”. Under the leadership of such a big billionaire, Tesla emerged out to become the world’s most
                popular
                and desirable car brands. Musk claims 2008 as the worst year of his life. With the financial crisis,
                Musk was
                broke, and he also had to pull out Tesla from the massive debt, and along with that, he was undergoing a
                divorce
                procedure.</p>

            <p class="card-text">In January 2018, Tesla revealed that Musk would not collect an annual payment but that
                it
                would instead raise
                money depending on the rising market cap that it wanted to achieve in the next ten years.

                With SpaceX, Elon Musk has signed several high-profile contracts to develop rockets and perform military
                missions with NASA and the United States Air Force. Musk was outspoken about his hopes for a joint
                project with
                NASA to send an Astronaut to Mars by the year 2025.</p>

            Elon Musk has always pushed all varieties of space-age technologies, but it was not still a perfect ride for
            him. He went on from being bullied in school to becoming a small entrepreneur and finally became the leader
            of
            two innovative companies. But from there, he decided to rise and never settle down for anything less.
