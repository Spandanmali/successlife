      <h3 class="card-title" style="text-decoration: underline;">Mark Zuckerberg</h3>
      <p>Born : May 14 (1384-Present)</p>
      <p>Mark Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York, and was raised in nearby Dobbs Ferry. He
        was born into a well-educated family and developed an interest in computer programming at an early age.</p>
      <p>At the age of 12, Zuckerberg created a messaging program named Zucknet that he implemented as an inter-office
        communication system for his father's dental practice.1 Due to his early signs of success, his parents got him a
        computer programming tutor while he was still in high school, and they enrolled him in a prep school in New
        Hampshire. After graduating from prep school, Zuckerberg enrolled at Harvard University.</p>
      <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Success Story</span></h3>
      <p>While many intelligent people attend Harvard University, Mark Zuckerberg became known quickly as the go-to
        computer programmer on campus. By his sophomore year, he had already built two programs: CourseMatch and
        FaceMash.1 Both programs became wildly popular, but the university shut down the latter program after it was
        deemed to be inappropriate.</p>
      <p>Based on his acclaim on campus, Zuckerberg partnered with friends to create a social networking site that
        allowed Harvard students to connect with each other. The site officially went live in June 2004 under the name
        "The Facebook," and Zuckerberg ran it out of his dorm room</p>
      <p>After his sophomore year, Zuckerberg dropped out of college to pursue what was now called Facebook, full-time.
        The website reached one million users by the end of 2004.2</p>

        <div class="card-body">
      <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Current Influence</span></h3>
      <p>Zuckerberg—who has a net worth of $119 billion as of May 2021—has signed the Giving Pledge, which means he will
        donate at least 50% of his net worth to philanthropic causes before he dies.6 In 2010, for example, he donated
        more than $100 million to save the Newark school system in New Jersey</p>
      <p>When his daughter Max was born in 2015, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan authored an open letter in which
        they pledged to give away 99% of their net worth during their lifetime.8 However, many have criticized the
        method by which Zuckerberg is donating his fortune. The charitable foundation Zuckerberg and Chan have set up is
        a limited-liability corporation, not a charitable trust. This decision allows the two to do things that
        charitable trusts are not allowed to do, which in turn could make the foundation more effective, though it might
        also benefit their family more than a traditional trust.</p>
