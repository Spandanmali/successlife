            <p class="card-text">Born : January 12 (1964-present)</p>

            <p class="card-text">Updated July 20,2021</p>
            <p class="card-text">American entrepreneur Jeff Bezos is the founder and chief executive officer of
                Amazon.com and owner of 'The Washington Post.' His successful business ventures have made him one of the
                richest people in the world.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Entrepreneur and e-commerce pioneer Jeff Bezos is the founder and CEO of the e-commerce
                company Amazon, owner of The Washington Post and founder of the space exploration company Blue Origin.
                His successful business ventures have made him one of the richest people in the world. Born in 1964 in
                New Mexico, Bezos had an early love of computers and studied computer science and electrical engineering
                at Princeton University. After graduation, he worked on Wall Street, and in 1990 he became the youngest
                senior vice president at the investment firm D.E. Shaw. Four years later, Bezos quit his lucrative job
                to open Amazon.com, an online bookstore that became one of the Internet's biggest success stories. In
                2013, Bezos purchased The Washington Post, and in 2017 Amazon acquired Whole Foods. In February 2021,
                Amazon announced that Bezos will step down as CEO in the third quarter of the year.</p>
            <h3><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Early Life and Education</strong></h3>
            <p class="card-text">The Jorgensens were married less than a year. When Bezos was 4 years old, his mother
                remarried Mike Bezos, a Cuban immigrant.

                Bezos graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University in 1986 with a degree in computer science and
                electrical engineering.

                Bezos showed an early interest in how things work, turning his parents' garage into a laboratory and
                rigging electrical contraptions around his house as a child.

                He moved to Miami with his family as a teenager, where he developed a love for computers and graduated
                valedictorian of his high school. It was during high school that he started his first business, the
                Dream Institute, an educational summer camp for fourth, fifth and sixth graders.</p></div>

            <h3><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Founder and CEO of Amazon.com</strong></h3>
            <p>Bezos opened Amazon.com, named after the meandering South American river, on July 16, 1995, after asking
                300
                friends to beta test his site. In the months leading up to launch, a few employees began developing
                software
                with Bezos in his garage; they eventually expanded operations into a two-bedroom house equipped with
                three
                Sun Microstations.</p>

            <p>The initial success of the company was meteoric. With no press promotion, Amazon.com sold books across
                the
                United States and in 45 foreign countries within 30 days. In two months, sales reached $20,000 a week,
                growing faster than Bezos and his startup team had envisioned.

                Amazon.com went public in 1997, leading many market analysts to question whether the company could hold
                its
                own when traditional retailers launched their own e-commerce sites. Two years later, the start-up not
                only
                kept up, but also outpaced competitors, becoming an e-commerce leader.</p>

            <p>Bezos continued to diversify Amazon’s offerings with the sale of CDs and videos in 1998, and later
                clothes,
                electronics, toys and more through major retail partnerships.

                While many dot.coms of the early '90s went bust, Amazon flourished with yearly sales that jumped from
                $510,000 in 1995 to over $17 billion in 2011.</p>

                    hard things well.” – Jeff Bezos</strong></h3>
