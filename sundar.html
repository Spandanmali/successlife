            <h3 class="card-title">Sundar Pichai</h3>
            <p>Born : 10 June (1972-present)</p>
            <p>Born on the 12th of July 1972, Sundararajan Pichai or better known as Sundar Pichai who has recently
                become the talk of literally every town, is the newly appointed CEO of Google Inc.

                Before the recent promotion, Sundar was the Product Chief at Google and the Right-Hand man behind the
                former CEO Larry Page.

                Sundar is widely known for his diplomatic skills within the company, and with an approximate net worth
                of $150 Million, the new honcho is highly regarded to be one of the most influential men in the world as
                well.</p>
            <p>With his strong team playing skills, he is one man who exactly knows how to get his work done, and that
                too without alienating the entire company.

                Talking about his personal life, Sundar is married to his college love Anjali and is the father of two
                children. He is also a huge cricket fan and was also the captain of his school cricket team</p>

                <div class="card-body">
            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Early Beginnings Of Sundar Pichai</h3>
            <p>As most us already know, Sundar belonged to a middle class Indian family from Tamil Nadu, where his
                father Regunatha Pichai was a Senior Electrical Engineer for the British conglomerate General Electric
                Company (GEC) and managed a factory that made electrical components, while his mother was a stenographer
                before she had children.

                Most of his childhood was spent in a two-room apartment, filled with a range of compromises. Going by
                the buzz on the internet, the family didn’t even own a car and got their first telephone when Sundar was
                12 years old</p>
            <p>He completed his schooling from Jawahar Vidyalaya School located in Chennai, which was followed by his
                degree in Metallurgical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (IIT KGP).

                The scholar that he was, his professors at IIT suggested that he pursue his PhD at Stanford University,
                but instead he decided to take another route and pursued his MS from Stanford University in Material
                Sciences and Engineering.

            </p>
            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Life At Google.</h3>
            <p>After leaving McKinsey, Sundar took the biggest leap of his life, and joined Google in 2004. His profile was to lead the product management and innovation efforts for a range of Google’s products and was also one of the responsible ones for the making and success of Google Drive.

                Now, when he began his work, he was assumed to be one of the many from the herd of highly intelligent Googlers, but he managed to rise beyond all the rest, in the time to come.</p>
                <h3>Rising Of The New CEO</h3>
                <p>Within a year’s time since becoming the Senior VP, Sundar was also handed over the task of Android as well, which till earlier was being managed by Andy Rubin. Android as we all know is a platform for smartwatches, TVs, cars and payments.

                    The genius that he is, Sundar developed it into “Android One” which was a project designed to offer affordable smartphones in all households worldwide, which today has expanded into 3 new versions of the Android mobile operating system famously known as – Jelly Bean, KitKat and the latest one being Lollipop. Collectively, they control 65% of America’s smartphone market.</p>
