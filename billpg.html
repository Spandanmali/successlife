      <h3 class="card-title" style="text-decoration: underline;">Bill Gates</h3>
      <p>Born : 28 October (1955-present) </p>
      <p>Entrepreneur Bill Gates founded the world's largest software business, Microsoft, with Paul Allen, and
        subsequently became one of the richest men in the world.</p>
      <p>Entrepreneur and businessman Bill Gates and his business partner Paul Allen founded and built the world's
        largest software business, Microsoft, through technological innovation, keen business strategy and aggressive
        business tactics. In the process, Gates became one of the richest men in the world. In February 2014, Gates
        announced that he was stepping down as Microsoft's chairman to focus on charitable work at his foundation, the
        Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>
      <h3><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Early Life</strong></h3>
      <p>Gates was born William Henry Gates III on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington. Gates grew up in an
        upper-middle-class family with his older sister, Kristianne, and younger sister, Libby. Their father, William H.
        Gates Sr., was a promising, if somewhat shy, law student when he met his future wife, Mary Maxwell. She was an
        athletic, outgoing student at the University of Washington, actively involved in student affairs and leadership.
      </p>
      <p>The Gates family atmosphere was warm and close, and all three children were encouraged to be competitive and
        strive for excellence. Gates showed early signs of competitiveness when he coordinated family athletic games at
        their summer house on Puget Sound. He also relished in playing board games (Risk was his favorite) and excelled
        at Monopoly.</p>
      <h3><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Harvard Dropout</strong></h3>
      <p>Gates enrolled at Harvard University in the fall of 1973, originally thinking of a career in law. Much to his
        parents' dismay, Gates dropped out of college in 1975 to pursue his business, Microsoft, with partner Allen.
      </p>
      <p>Gates spent more of his time in the computer lab than in class. He did not really have a study regimen; he got
        by on a few hours of sleep, crammed for a test, and passed with a reasonable grade. </p>
      <h3><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Founding Microsoft</strong></h3>
      <p>In 1975, Gates and Allen formed Micro-Soft, a blend of "micro-computer" and "software" (they dropped the hyphen
        within a year). The company's first product was BASIC software that ran on the Altair computer.

        At first, all was not smooth sailing. Although Microsoftâ€™s BASIC software program for the Altair computer netted
        the company a fee and royalties, it wasn't meeting their overhead. According to Gates' later account, only about
        10 percent of the people using BASIC in the Altair computer had actually paid for it.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h3><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Rivalry With Steve Jobs</strong></h3>
      <p>Though their rivalry is legend, Microsoft and Apple shared many of their early innovations. In 1981, Apple, at
        the time led by Steve Jobs, invited Microsoft to help develop software for Macintosh computers. Some developers
        were involved in both Microsoft development and the development of Microsoft applications for Macintosh. The
        collaboration could be seen in some shared names between the Microsoft and Macintosh systems.</p>
      <p>It was through this knowledge sharing that Microsoft developed Windows, a system that used a mouse to drive a
        graphic interface, displaying text and images on the screen. This differed greatly from the text-and-keyboard
        driven MS-DOS system where all text formatting showed on the screen as code and not what actually would be
        printed.
