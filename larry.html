            <h3 class="card-title">Larry page</h3>
            <p>Born : 26 March (1973-Present)</p>
            <p>It's hard to believe that one of the world's most important CEOs started his company with no idea of how it could make money. Larry Page, born in Lansing, Michigan, in in 1973, is an icon of the web, heading one of its most important companies through a transitional period in internet history. He is also an inspiring, influential, and very interesting success story for entrepreneurs to learn from.Born into a family that radiated computing, Larry Page's early life was spent surrounded by math and its products.</p>
            <p>From early computers to high-end scientific calculators, his father's obsession for computing and incredible advances in the science behind early computers caused a deep desire to succeed in Larry, particularly in the fields of computer science and technology.He achieved early success with computers, becoming the first student at his high school to use an early computer to complete a science project. His family's obsession with technology and unique style caused him to believe early in his life that he would probably start his own company, rather than spending his life working on behalf of someone else.</p>
            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Early Life.</h3>
            <p>As with all great predictions, this one came true, and during his studies at Stanford University, a young Larry Page ran into Sergey Brin, an immigrant science student from the Soviet Union. At first, they clashed, bringing new idea into arguments and generally acting fairly abrasively to each other. However, over time they became close friends and 'intellectual equals' for each other.</p>
            <p>Their collaboration on various projects at Stanford resulted in BackRub, an early search engine that indexed pages around the school's intranet and made them searchable for users. The project was an immense hit at the university, attracting praise and remarks about its potential for helping the world to access information. It also became a major source of spent time for Page and Brin.In fact, Google became such a time-sink for the pair that they made several attempts to sell it early in its lifespan, often for values far below what you would have expected. However, instead of any sales, they received immense attention from investors.</p></div>

            <div class="card-body">
            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Meeting Of Page And Brin</h3>
            <p>In 1996, Page entered Stanford University to study. During his PhD in computer science, he met Sergey Brin. Since then, two close partners have embarked on their brilliant career journey.</p>
            <p>Stanford University has a gathering of elites and fierce competition. In order to complete his doctoral dissertation, Page “killed” more than a dozen very interesting ideas. And determined the topic of the thesis as the rapidly developing Internet at that time. In the process of writing the paper, Page consulted a large number of computer and Internet materials. Which will also be of great benefit to his future development direction.</p>
            <h3>Establishment of Google (Success Story of Google)</h3>
            <p>It seems that they are not far from running a formal company. However, lack of funds has become a major problem. In order to raise start-up funds, Page and Brin rushed around, and finally borrowed a precious $1 million. In September 1998, Google was formally established in California.</p>
            <p>At first, Google had only 3 employees, and it increased to 8 after half a year. Today, even a small company has more than 8 employees. At the time, these 8 employees were the backbone of Google’s operations. Who would have thought that the number of employees in a small company of 8 people would have reached more than 50,000 today?</p>
            <p>In fact, before the founding of Google, Page and Brin had found one of the founders of Yahoo, David Philo. Philo affirmed the ideas and technologies of Page and Brin. And he also suggested that they establish a search engine company. Develop an independent business.</p>
